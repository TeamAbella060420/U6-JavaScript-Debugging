What is Debugging? - If you've ever written code you expected to do one thing, and it did another, you've created a bug. Experienced developers create bugs all the time as they work, though, so don't feel bad! The key is having tools and strategies to help you identify and fix those bugs quickly, so you can move on to the next task. This is the essence of debugging.
